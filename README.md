# WikiNext: Trigram-Based Next-Word Predictor

## Overview
**WikiNext** is an NLP project that predicts the next word in a sequence using trigrams trained on Wikipedia data. It uses Laplace smoothing for robust predictions and evaluates performance using perplexity. The project is built with Python, NLTK, Wikipedia API, and Streamlit.

## Features
- **Trigram-Based Model**: Predicts next words using trigrams.
- **Laplace Smoothing**: Handles zero-probability cases.
- **Perplexity Calculation**: Evaluates model performance.
- **Stemming**: Normalizes words using Porter Stemmer.
- **Interactive Interface**: Built with Streamlit for easy use.
- **Customizable Corpus**: Users can input topics and set corpus size.
